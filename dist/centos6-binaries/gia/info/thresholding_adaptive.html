<P>The entire image is broken up into smaller square arrays of block size w, defaulted to be 50x50 pixels. Next, within each sub-image block, the mean pixel intensity, I0, is calculated.  The values of all other pixels that are a certain mean shift C, defaulted to be  5%, above I0,, are considered to be part of the root network, all others are considered to be part of the background (and are set to 1 and 0 respectively). Finally, all connected clusters of 1-s (i.e., part of the network) are found, and those clusters which are smaller than some critical size, b, are removed.  The parameter for this is listed as "Ignore con comp of size less" which means "Ignore conncted components of size less than b".  Because thresholding is local, this method is better suited for non-stationary background intensity as is commonly found in images of root systems.</p>
