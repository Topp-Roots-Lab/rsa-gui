<p>The pixel values of all points are compared to a threshold value.  Those pixels whose intensity is less than the threshold value are set to 0 (black).  Those pixels whose intensity is greater than the threshold value are set to 1 (white).  Note that for images whose color intensities are reversed, there is an advanced feature which allows the foreground/background designation to be flipped.</p>
